# Sample Wireframe
To demonstrate my ability to perform the core competencies required in the Anki Product Management Internship, I have created User Stories, Acceptance Criteria and a Wireframe for a website based on a prompt. The project prompt is about a topic that is close to home for me given that I have the opportunity to be able to observe how elderly people are treated in my homecountry of India vs. USA

## Product Prompt

* They need to listen to the advise of those that have lived in the previous generations. This is something not taught in schools.

### Solution:
* A low-cost nonprofit that connects honors high school students with elderly people need a hand in hoe care and want the company.
